# Omdena_solar_radiation_app
Web application developed using Streamlit to predict solar radiations.

This is the final project of the Omdena **MLOps for AI Engineers and Data Scientists**.

The objective of this project was to deploy an application to predict the solar radiation prediction model that was created during previous assignments.
This code was not deployed to Heroku. The application was deployed to a local server using Streamlit.
